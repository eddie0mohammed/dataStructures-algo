Binary Heap

similar to BST 

Types:
1. min heap
parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
2. max heap
parent nodes are always larger to child nodes

methods: 
1. insert
2. remove



important: 
A binary heap is as compact as possible.
all children of each node are as full as they can be.
 => Left children are filled out first



 Representing a heap:

 1.parent @ index n:
 left child => 2n + 1
 right child => 2n + 2


2. child at index n:
parent => Math.floor((n - 1) / 2);
