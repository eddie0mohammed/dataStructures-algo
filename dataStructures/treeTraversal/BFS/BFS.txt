- ITERATIVE APPROACH

- uses a queue (array)
and visited(array)

-places root node in the queue
- loop as long as there is something in the queue
    - dequeue a node from queue and push to visited
    - if there is a left on the dequeued node, add it to queue,
    - if there is a right on the dequeued node, add it to the queue
    -

    -finally return the visited variable
