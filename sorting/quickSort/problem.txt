QUICK SORT

recursive

1. pivot helper (arr, start = 0, end = arr.length - 1)
select a pivot elem. loop through the array and moves every elem smaller than
the pivot elem to the left of the pivot and moves every elem greater that
the selected pivot to the right of the pivot;

finally returns the index of the pivot elem.


2. quickSort function  (arr, left = 0, right = arr.length - 1)
recursive
while left < right 
use helper method to find pivot index;
calls quickSort on left part 0 to pivot - 1;
calls quickSort on right part pivot + 1 to arr.length - 1;
